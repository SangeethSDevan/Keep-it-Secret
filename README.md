# Keep-it-Secret Encryption and Decryption App

Welcome to Keep-it-Secret, a simple encryption and decryption application utilizing the Caesar cipher technique with a shift of 5. This README provides an overview of the app and instructions on how to use it effectively.

## Introduction
Keep-it-Secret is a web-based tool designed to encrypt and decrypt text messages using the Caesar cipher, a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. With Keep-it-Secret, you can encode your sensitive messages and decode them back to their original form securely.

## Features
- Simple and intuitive user interface.
- Encryption of text messages using the Caesar cipher with a shift of 5.
- Decryption of encoded messages to reveal the original text.
- Accessible via web browser, no installation required.
- Secure encryption and decryption process.

## Usage
1. Visit the Keep-it-Secret website at [https://keep-it-secret.onrender.com](https://keep-it-secret.onrender.com).
2. You will be presented with a text area labeled "Enter Text" (The Entered text must be with in a range of a sentence).
3. To encrypt a message, type or paste your plaintext message into the "Enter Text" area.
4. Click on the "Encrypt" button.
5. Your encrypted message will appear in the "Encrypted Text" area.
6. To decrypt an encoded message, paste the ciphertext into the "Enter Text" area.
7. Click on the "Decrypt" button.
8. Your decrypted message will appear in the "Decrypted Text" area.

**Note:** Make sure to remember the shift value (5 in this case) used for encryption, as you'll need it to decrypt the message correctly.

## Security
While the Caesar cipher is a basic encryption technique, Keep-it-Secret employs it for educational and demonstrative purposes rather than for high-security applications. It's essential to understand that Caesar cipher, including this implementation, can be easily broken with modern cryptanalysis techniques. Therefore, it's not suitable for sensitive or confidential data.
